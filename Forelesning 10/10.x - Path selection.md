# 10.5 - Path selection

Som andre white-box-tester bør denne brukes for mindre bolker kode (>200 linjer).




Variabler brukes i utregninger og i kondisjonaler.


duk - defined, used, killed

Ni patterns

* __dd__: define and then define again – __error__
* __dk__: define and then kill – __error__
* __ku__: kill and then used – __error__
* __kk__: kill and then kill again – __error__
* __du__: define and then use – __OK__
* __kd__: kill and then redefine – __OK__
* __ud__: use and then redefine – __OK__
* __uk__: use and then kill – __OK__
* __uu__: use and then use – __OK__



## Dynamic data flow testing

Basert på de tre metodene vil en kunne definere sju teststrategier. 

* AD - All definitions
	* test cases cover each definition of each variable for at least one use of the variable.
* APU - All predicate uses
	* there is at least one path of each definition to p-use of the variable
* ACU - All computational uses
	* there is at least one path of each variable to each c- use of the variable
* APU+C - All P-uses/some C-uses
	* there is at least one path of each variable to each c- use of the variable. If there are any variable definitions that are not covered then cover a c-use
* ACU+P - All C-uses/some P uses
	* there is at least one path of each variable to each c-use of the variable. If there are any variable definitions that are not covered then cover a p-use.
* AU - All uses
	* there is at least one path of each variable to each c-use and each p- use of the variable.
* ADUP - All DU-paths
	* test cases cover every simple sub-path from each variable definition to every p-use and c-use of that variable.


![Relationship between strategies](Forelesning 10/img/relstrat.png)

Since full path testing often will require us to execute a large number of paths, the duk-strategy helps us to reduce the number of paths necessary.



# 10.5 - Use of coverage measures

It is possible to show that the following relation holds under a rather wide set of conditions:

MTTF >= e * T/N0

N0 The initial number of defects – N0 – must be
estimated e.g. based on experience from earlier projects as number of defects per KLOC.
