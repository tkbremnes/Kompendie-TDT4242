## Reval Cafe
Vene st. Nice decor, good coffee, excellent cakes, snacks, WIFI, corners, laptop friendly tables. There's an upstairs which is a little quieter, and window tables downstairs if you want to look out.


## Kohvik Narva
There are loads of places around. For good value, decent coffee, WIFI and a bit of peace, I like .

## Levist Väljas
Inside this cellar bar, you'll find broken furniture, cheap booze and a refreshingly motley crew of punks, has-beens and anyone else who strays from the well-trodden tourist path. For some this is the quintessential Tallinn bar, for others it's an unpronounceable dive bar. Regardless, it's one possible choice when other bars close.

## Depeche Mode Baar
Nunne 4

This dark corner of Estonia is filled with black-clad, rake-thin Depeche Mode fans sipping on Master & Servant or Personal Jesus cocktails while listening to the band’s cold melancholia. Autographed photos, DM artwork and tour memorabilia line the walls, while video screens play continuous Mode videos. A bleak hell for some; sweet heaven for others. The bar is located at Nunne 4, Tallinn; just follow the DM lookalikes. Check out pics here.

## Kompressor
Tallinn, Estonia
Restaurants › Desserts
Eat one of the enormous, stuffed pancakes and you'll be full for the rest of the day. The large hall and casual atmosphere make it a great hang-out too; the big tables make it easy to chat up locals.

## Olde Hansa
Tallinn, Estonia
Restaurants › Pub
If you'll splurge just once in Tallinn, here's where to do it. This medieval-themed restaurant (more authentic than kitsch!) boasts first and foremost the most ebullient and friendly service in the city, plus exotic meats (elk, wild boar) and homemade delights like juniper cheese and honey beer. It's a fun atmosphere inside or out on the terrace, and the food and its creative presentation is always first-rate.
